# AccessibilityRefactor
Refactor existing code that follows accessibility standards.

While the existing code works to launch a functioning website, it's code had errors that prevented it from being considered accessible, and even puts the company's website at risk for being ranked lowly on search engines. The goal is to gain better reach for the company.

By improving the code, it'll allow more widespread accessibility, especially people with disabilities. By changing HTML tags, it will also allow the website to be more easily found via search engines. Additionally, increasing the font size makes it easier to read. In refactoring the CSS code, redundant code was removed, which helps other coders and my future self read the file more easily if changes need to be made.

In refactoring the code, it is made obvious how changing simple codes and adding "invisible" text can improve a website's functionality and visibility, and that spending a few extra minutes can really make others' lives easier. It is also very important to keep in mind that if you edit the HTML code, it is crucuial to also edit that corresponding tag, element, class, id used in CSS to maintain your design.

As a side note for future accessibility refactors, it may be important to also keep not only the starting code for reference, but also a starting screenshot and website open to ensure that only accessibility was changed/improved. We do not want to change the design or functionality that the client wants to keep.
