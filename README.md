# AccessibilityRefactor
Refactor existing code that follows accessibility standards.

While the existing code works to launch a functioning website, it's code had errors that prevented it from being considered accessible, and even puts the company's website at risk for being ranked lowly on search engines. The goal is to gain better reach for the company.

By improving the code, it'll allow more widespread accessibility, especially people with disabilities. By changing HTML tags, it will also allow the website to be more easily found via search engines. Additionally, increasing the font size makes it easier to read.

In refactoring the code, it is made obvious how changing simple codes and adding "invisible" text can improve a website's functionality and reachability, and that spending a few extra minutes can really make others' lives easier.
